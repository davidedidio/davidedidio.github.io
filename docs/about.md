## Hi, I'm Davide Di Dio

I love technology, creating software and automating things.

I graduated from EPFL as data science engineer and now work as software engineer at SBB.

I love working on projects especially those that relate to data science or visualization. Send me a request if you need my help for your project.

## Projects
### [Smood Data Visualisation](https://tgyal.github.io/dataviz-smood/)
A visualization project made at EPFL together with Tanguy Albrici and Fatine Benhsain. The end project displays which paths the Smood driver use most often, where the deliveries come from and go to.
